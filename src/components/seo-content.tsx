                        The real estate markets in London and Dubai continue to offer exceptional opportunities for global investors.
                        London remains a safe haven for capital preservation, with zones 1-6 showing promising growth due to improved transport links and regeneration projects.
                        Meanwhile, Dubai offers some of the highest rental yields in the world, tax-free income, and attractive payment plans for off-plan properties.
